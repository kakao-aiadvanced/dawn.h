If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\n",
      "For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\n",
      "However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\n",

      "And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\n",

He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.\n",
      "He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.\n",
      "Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.\n",
      "He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15\n",
      "After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.\n",
      "These form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\n",

What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "The students are divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts where 3 parts are for males and 2 parts are for females.\n",
      "Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.\n",
      "So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.\n",

He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
